<h2  style="display:inline;"> Building a Successful Story Point Estimation
</h2>

&nbsp;


In Story sizing, team does a comparative analysis between all of the stories for the project. For each story to be sized, do the following as a team(Product Owner, Core Scrum team including developers, testers & scrum master):


1. Identify base stories.

2. Talk through the requirements of the story

3. Discuss and jot down things you want to remember when implementing this story

4. Find some point of relative comparison

5. Reach a consensus among entire team present as to the size of the story as per Definition of Done.

7. Validate that your estimates are internally consistent among stories as you go along.

8. Periodically ensure that all of the 1’s are about the same, all of the 2’s match, etc.
