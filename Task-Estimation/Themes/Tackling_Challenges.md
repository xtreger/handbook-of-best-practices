&nbsp;

We can combat challenges facing the task estimation process in scrum using agile planning techniques:


+ Work is done in iterations, in each of which a set of features is taken from a set of requirements, to a finished and deliverable solution. Planning is done at an iteration and at a release level separately.

+ Prioritise the features for a release, so that high value features (or user stories) can be delivered first. Also define the conditions of satisfaction at both a feature, and a project level, so the aims of each iteration and the release as a whole are clear.

+ Continuously update the plans, and priorities, as knowledge is gained throughout the project.

+ The estimated backlog doesnâ€™t directly give a time estimate for the whole project (which is what stakeholders often would prefer to know).

+ An additional problem some applications face is that the tasks to be implemented are not picked randomly from the backlog.
