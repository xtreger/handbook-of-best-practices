<h2  style="display:inline;"> Bad practices of Task Estimation
</h2>

&nbsp;

Teams can get better at estimating tasks to provide accurate forecasts. Common biggest pain point for the teams is predictability. The following scenarios are examples where the team may fail to conduct good task estimation practices :

+ Teams are interrupted with production issues or other responsibilities.

+ Teams gives estimates as if they were full-time dedicated, but they have many initiatives in progress.

+ Teams aren't stable; people come and go regularly to help on other things or contractors leave the program entirely.

+ Team is working on a brand new initiative and has never done this kind of work before.
