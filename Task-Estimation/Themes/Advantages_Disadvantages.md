<h2  style="display:inline;"> Advantages and disadvantages of twice estimation</h2>


&nbsp;


Twice estimation in sprint planning allows the team to break down into small tasks team members can pick-up. The team estimates these tasks in hours. The total work is the sum of all tasks in hours. This can then be compared to he actual capacity of the team to deliver work. The following table showcases the advantages and disadvantages of twice estimation:

| Advantages| Disadvantages |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| More Control Over Your Sprint | 	Overhead Which Does Not Necessarily Improve Accuracy Of Estimates |
| 	More Accurate Estimates | Working In Hours In Combination With Logging Hours |
| 	Preventing Over- And Under Committing | Working In Hours May Lead To Micro-Managing Or Punishing Team Members |
| 		Clear How Much Work Is Left For Unfinished Issues |  |
| 	Valuable Input For Retrospective |  |
