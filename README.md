## Code Reviews


Code reviews are a very important part of the software development process which involves analysing
the source code to identify bugs. A code review process is typically conducted 
before merging with the codebase.

Code reviews improve code quality making your codebase more stable. They prevent bugs and errors
from getting into your project at an early stage of the software development process.
