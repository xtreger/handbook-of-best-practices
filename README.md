# Handbook of Best Practices

## Task Estimation


The Sprint Planning meeting is the Scrum ceremony where the team estimates all tasks associated with each user story in the Sprint backlog. 
The estimation effort focuses on all resources required to complete the tasks for each Sprint. 

A shared task list is used to estimate the 
duration and effort for each user story in the backlog. This practice results in a shared team perspective, resulting in a task estimation 
process that is consistent and reliable throughout all Sprints. 
In this section of the handbook we will discuss the following points : 


 + Building a successful story point estimation
 + The importance of story point estimation
 + Challenges of accurately estimating tasks
 + Overcoming estimation challenges
 + Bad practices of task estimation
 + Advantages and disadvantages of twice estimation

### 1. Building a successful story point estimation

---
In Task Estimation, team does a comparative analysis between all of the stories for the project. For each story to be sized, 
 the following as a team(Product Owner, Core Scrum team including developers, testers & scrum master):

### 2. The importance of story point estimation

---

Often happens that one person estimates a project, but other people complete the tasks. In this case, Story Points are indispensable. An example of why story points better than hours is illustrated in the example below:

> A company has a project at 200 story points(SP). One engineer starts working on it. His velocity is 1 SP per 3 hours. The start date is May 30th. Based on this information.

it’s easy to calculate the project release date as follows:

1. The time needed to finish all the work :


    **T=Qsp*t**
       
    200x3 = 600 (hours).

2. The number of workdays:

    **Nw=T/Prt**
       
    600 / 6 = 100 (workdays).

**Solution:** Having a calendar at hand, we can then calculate a release date — October 14th.

| Formula keywords |  |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Qsp   | general quantity of SP |
| T | Time |
| Nw    | Number of days |
| Prt    | quantity of productive hours (usually 6 hours) |
