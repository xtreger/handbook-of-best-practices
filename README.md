### 3. Challenges

---

Even-though task estimation provides usefulness in project planning as mentioned in the above points. There are a few challenges facing individuals who are assigned with task estimation would be :

* Distinction between estimates and commitments.
* Features are not prioritised and are just developed in a random order.
* Uncertainty in those estimates is often ignored.
* Planning is often based on completing activities rather than features.

### 4. Overcoming estimation challenges

---

It is worth highlighting the challenges behind creating good estimates. The key motivation behind good estimation is to be useful for project planning. The following points would guide any engineer to overcome challenges facing the task estimation process in scrum:


1. Get Two Perspectives On The Project
2. Use Past Knowledge
3. Involve The People Who Will Actually Do The Work
4. Factor In The Partnerships
5. Identify and Investigate High-Risk Items

### 5. Bad practices of task estimation

---

Teams can get better at estimating tasks to provide accurate forecasts. Common biggest pain point for the teams is predictability. The following scenarios are examples where the team may fail to conduct good task estimation practices :


1. Teams are interrupted with production issues or other 
responsibilities.

2. Teams gives estimates as if they were full-time dedicated, but they have many initiatives in progress.

3. Teams aren't stable; people come and go regularly to help on other things or contractors leave the program entirely.

4. Team is working on a brand new initiative and has never done this kind of work before.

### 6. Advantages and disadvantages of twice estimation

---

Twice estimation in sprint planning allows the team to break down into small tasks team members can pick-up. The team estimates these tasks in hours. The total work is the sum of all tasks in hours. This can then be compared to he actual capacity of the team to deliver work. The following table showcases the advantages and disadvantages of twice estimation:

| Advantages| Disadvantages |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| More Control Over Your Sprint | 	Overhead Which Does Not Necessarily Improve Accuracy Of Estimates |
| 	More Accurate Estimates | Working In Hours In Combination With Logging Hours |
| 	Preventing Over- And Under Committing | Working In Hours May Lead To Micro-Managing Or Punishing Team Members |
| 		Clear How Much Work Is Left For Unfinished Issues |  |
| 	Valuable Input For Retrospective |  |
