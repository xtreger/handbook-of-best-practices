# Handbook of Best Practices

This handbook contains a set of best practices that are proven approaches to software development.
When used in combination, they focus on the main causes of software development problems. They are
called "best practices" not because we can specifically measure their value but rather they are
viewed to frequently be used in industry by successful organizations. Each of the best practices
emphasize and empower each other in order to accomplish the best results.
